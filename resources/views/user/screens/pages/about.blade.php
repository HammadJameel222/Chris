                            Chris Aire is a tried and tested veteran of the luxury watch and jewelry industry.
                            One of the most talented and influential jewelry and watch designers in the world
                            today, Chris Aire has dazzled his loyal celebrity and high net-worth clientele for over
                            30 years with his timeless range of finely crafted products. And as the creator of the
                            widely-acclaimed RED GOLD速 brand, he has demonstrated an inexhaustible capacity
                            for innovation, changing the trajectory of the watch and jewelry industry in the process.
                            Chris Aire timepieces, like his jewelry collections, are highly coveted among tastemakers
                            around the globe. Each new series, such as the latest Parlay, reaches new heights in
                            design and artisanship.

                            African-born Aire moved to the United States as a teen and attended college in
                            California. He worked full-time at a restaurant to make ends meet and slept in his rusty
                            old BMW. After a post-college foray into music and acting, a friend's father gave him his
                            first opportunity at what would become his life's work: jewelry. Aire discovered a keen
                            interest in beautiful gemstones and intricate craftsmanship and an aptitude for
                            developing both to their fullest potential.

                            After six years of working as a jeweler's apprentice, Aire used his life savings ($5,000!)
                            to create some design prototypes of his own. He set up shop at various hot spots
                            around L.A., hoping to engage the interest of a high-profile "dream clientele."

                            His big break occurred when legendary NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton ordered
                            platinum basketball pendants, charms, and bracelets for his crew. Soon after, Aire
                            became the go-to jeweler for the NBA's most notable stars, the film industry's A-list,
                            and watch and luxury aficionados around the world. He enthralls these influencers by
                            his signature dog tag pendants, bespoke commissions, and, of course, his impeccably
                            crafted watches, as well as his now-legendary Signature RED GOLD速 Collection.

                            Aire introduced his Signature RED GOLD速 collection in 1988, which demonstrated his intuitive
                            understanding of his male clientele. He knew they would
                            resonate with the more masculine-sounding "red gold" than the traditional "rose gold," which was
                            getting no traction in the market. Aire was correct: the
                            collection exponentially expanded his business. In 2003, he officially trademarked the term and
                            has continued to produce watches and jewelry using this
                            name. Aire has repeatedly and successfully defended RED GOLD速 over the years against brands that
                            have sought to emulate his revolutionary accomplishment.

                            Aire once again made history in 2004 when he became the first jeweler to stage a runway show of
                            his jewelry in New York Fashion Week. Supermodel
                            Naomi Campbell walked that first show in a diamond halter, followed by May Andersen in 2006, who
                            wore a $41 million bejeweled dress. His creativity,
                            in-depth knowledge of the industry, personal relationships with customers, and solid loyalty are
                            all qualities that will take the company to its rightful place
                            in the luxury market.
